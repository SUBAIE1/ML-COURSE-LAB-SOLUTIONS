Start by selecting one tabular dataset from an open-source platform.

Your dataset should be in CSV or Excel format and should be suitable for a machine learning
task such as prediction or pattern discovery.

Once you select a dataset, your next task is to clearly define the machine learning problem.
Ask yourself:

• Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem?
• Is there a target variable?
• What is the model expected to learn or predict?

Write a short problem description in your own words.

Create a Jupyter Notebook and load your dataset using Pandas.

At this stage, you only need to:
• Load the dataset
• Display its shape
• Preview the first few rows
• Check column names and data types

The final task in this lab is to create a methodology diagram that explains your machine learning
workflow. This diagram should visually represent how the project would proceed from start to
finish.

Export your diagram as a PNG or PDF and save it in your GitHub repository.

Your work for this lab must be submitted through GitHub only.
Your GitHub repository must contain:
• A short written summary describing the dataset and machine learning problem
• A Jupyter Notebook that loads the dataset and displays basic information
• The methodology diagram saved as an image or PDF
